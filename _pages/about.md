Hello there :wave::wave:.

Welcome to my homepage! :handshake: :handshake: 

I am currently a researcher of [the Institute of Innovation for Future Socity (InFuS)](https://www.mirai.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) and [Nagoya Univ., Center for Embedded Computing Systems (NCES)](https://www.nces.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) at Nagoya University in Japna :japan:.  

I received my B.S. and M.E. degrees from ***Wuhan University***, and my Ph.D. degree from ***Nagoya University***.

This figure :point_up: illustrates my R&D vision and shows that my research interests include, but are not limited to:
- Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV)
- High-Defination (HD) map
- Dynamic Map (DM) 
- Vehicle Motion Prediction
- Sensor Fusion
- Edge and Cloud Computing
